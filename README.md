### 📊 Customer Churn Analysis using Python & Power BI

🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing customer churn patterns to help businesses understand the key factors influencing customer retention. Using **Python** for data exploration and **Power BI** for interactive visualization, the analysis provides insights into churn trends, demographics, and predictive churn profiles.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Prediction:** Statistical/ML insights integrated with Power BI

## 📈 Key Features

* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover churn factors.
* Built **Power BI dashboards** visualizing KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners.
* Analyzed churn by **gender, age group, payment method, and contract type**.
* Created **prediction dashboards** highlighting customers at risk of churn.
* Provided **actionable insights** for improving customer retention.

## 📊 Insights

* Month-to-month contracts and mailed check payments have higher churn rates.
* Customers with longer tenure show lower churn probability.
* State-wise churn variations indicate regional service differences.
